# CryptoMomo

CryptoMomo is a USSD based service that allows the transfer of digital tokens/assets based on the phone number of the recipient. 
This eliminates and reduces the learning curve associated with onboarding new users into cryptocurrency and the blockchain.

With cryptoMomo users don’t need to create a wallet (metamask, connectWallet, etc), rather cryptoMomo converts a user's phone number into a blockchain address. 

This instantly puts 515 million people subscribed to mobile services in Sub- Saharan Africa on the blockchain.
